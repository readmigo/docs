**Thought Leadership**
The language learning market is $287B and growing 16% annually.

Yet most products focus on exercises and drills—not real-world reading.

That's the gap Readmigo fills. We've built an AI-native platform that makes authentic English literature accessible to billions of non-native speakers.

Our approach:
• Context-aware AI assistance (not just translation)
• Passive learning through reading (not active drilling)
• Public domain content (zero licensing costs)
• Spaced repetition retention (proven methodology)

Early results are promising. Readers report finishing books they'd struggled with for years.

Sometimes the best innovation isn't a new idea—it's making existing content radically more accessible.
